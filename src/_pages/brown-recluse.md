However, if you are seeing them inside your house you probably want them removed as soon as possible. {{ site.title }} offers a specialized Brown Recluse treatment service for our clients to rid your home of these pests quickly. 


## Brown Recluse Behavior and Bites
Brown recluse spiders do pose a slight risk, and they have been known to bite people. However, brown recluse bites occur in very rare circumstances. It is very possible to reside in a home that is infested with brown recluses and never get bitten. The majority of brown recluse spider bites happen when the spider is caught against bare skin. For instance, bites have occurred when people put on a shoe with a spider inside or roll over on a brown recluse in bed.
