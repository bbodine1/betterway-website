## Termite Control

The first step to avoiding a termite problem is having your home regularly inspected for termites. And because termites feast 24/7 and can strike your home at any time, it's recommended that you have your home inspected at least once a year, or anytime you suspect termite activity. The cost of a termite inspection can vary based on the company, though many, if not most, offer free inspections. Better Way Pest Control offers a free inspection.

Note: If an inspection is for a real estate transaction, there are normally fees associated because additional wood destroying insects are included and a formal report must be submitted. Learn more about wood destroying organisms reports here.
